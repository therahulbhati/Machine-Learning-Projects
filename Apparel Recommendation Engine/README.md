# Apparel Recommendation Engine
In this project, I have developed a recommendation engine to recommend similar apparel products in e-commerce using product descriptions and images. I have collected data using ‘Amazon product advertising API’ then applied various text processing and visualization techniques. I have used combination pretrained models Word2Vec and VGG-16 to find similar apparels. Used Word2Vec - To find text semantics based product similarity and VGG-16 - for visual features based similarity.
